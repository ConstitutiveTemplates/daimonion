"""W4: the declared support matrix, its witness evidence, and its docs.

`support.yml` is the human-approved declaration; `tests/matrix/witnesses.json`
is what the witness tiers actually ran. These tests keep the two honest:
every `supported` combination must be a leaf the full tier executed and
passed, `docs/reference/support.md` must be exactly what `tools/gen_docs.py`
renders from `support.yml` (the same `--check` gate CI runs), and the
`tier: none` exclusion hook must never be used without a reason.
