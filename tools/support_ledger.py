"""The declared support contract (`support.yml`): the reader and its doc renderer.

`support.yml` is the human-approved declaration of which witness-leaf
combinations this template keeps working, at which verification tier, and
with what measured evidence (`why`). Two consumers read it, so the reading
and the table rendering live in one place (TODO.md §28.5 R5): the docs
generator (tools/gen_docs.py renders the catalogue's compact summary and the
full `docs/reference/support.md` from it) and the MCP server (the
`template://support` resource). tests/test_support_matrix.py keeps the
declaration honest against the witness ledger.

The full support page also renders the committed update-rehearsal report
(`docs/data/update-rehearsal.json`, written by tools/update_rehearsal.py
--json and committed by .github/workflows/update-rehearsal.yml): the
"Update rehearsal" section at the end of the page is that JSON made
readable, and its reader lives here beside the other doc renderer.

This is a foundations-layer module by the tests/test_tool_layers.py table:
data files in, markdown text out -- no template tree, no subprocess.
