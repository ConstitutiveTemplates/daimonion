# Governance

This document states how decisions are made in this repository. It is
short on purpose: the project currently has one maintainer, and pretending
otherwise would be less honest than saying so plainly.

## Current model: BDFL

The project is maintained as a **BDFL-style project** with a single
maintainer: [kasi-x](https://github.com/kasi-x) (also the sole entry in
[.github/CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS)). The maintainer:

- decides the roadmap and the scope boundaries (see the "What this is
  deliberately not" section of
  [docs/explanations/vision.md](docs/explanations/vision.md) and the scope
  rules in [TODO.md](TODO.md));
- merges or rejects pull requests;
- is, for now, the bus factor. This is a known risk and the reason the
  next section exists.

## Adding maintainers

A second maintainer will be added when someone has:

1. a track record here — several merged, non-trivial PRs, or substantial
   reviewed feedback on the questionnaire/design surfaces;
2. demonstrated agreement with the design principles
   ([docs/explanations/design-principles.md](docs/explanations/design-principles.md))
   — in particular the reluctance to add a new `project_type` or option
   without a "what existing layer does this sit on?" answer;
3. time to review, not only to build.

The invitation is made by the current maintainer, publicly in an issue.

## Layer ownership

The questionnaire's layers are listed in [.github/CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS)
by path (question fragment, template files, preset, per-layer tests). Each
layer may have a distinct owner once contributors exist.

**Ownerless-layer rule**: a layer whose row lists no owner besides the
maintainer is *supported* but not *staffed*. When the maintainer stops
reviewing a layer's area, that layer's leaves drop to the `experimental`
tier in [docs/reference/support.md](docs/reference/support.md) — they keep
rendering, but the support matrix says so honestly rather than implying a
reviewer exists. Regaining `supported` requires a named owner who reviews
that layer's PRs.

**Promotion path** (triager → layer owner → core maintainer):

1. *Triager*: anyone may triage issues and review PRs informally; sustained,
   accurate triage is the visible track record.
2. *Layer owner*: a contributor with several merged non-trivial PRs inside
   one layer is added to that layer's CODEOWNERS row by the maintainer.
   Layer owners review changes in their area; merges still go through the
   maintainer.
3. *Core maintainer*: a layer owner who additionally meets the "Adding
   maintainers" criteria above and reviews outside their layer.

## How contributions are reviewed

- **Big changes start as an issue first** (also stated in
  [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)). "Big" means: a new
  question, project type, layer, or anything that changes generated files
  for existing answers.
- Every change that adds behavior must add a test that fails without it.
  The repo's own QA suite (ruff, basedpyright, zizmor/actionlint, the
  render-matrix tests) is the minimum bar; CI must be green.
- Changes to the questionnaire must keep the structural tests green:
  fragment union, forward-only references, and the Z3 satisfiability sweep
  (`tests/test_copier_structure.py`).
- Template defaults and pins must respect the freshness policy
  ([docs/explanations/template-dev.md](docs/explanations/template-dev.md))
  and, where a value is hardcoded, the upstream-check tooling
  (`tools/check_upstream.py`).

## Ethics, regional, and operational rules

The rules under `_shared/ethics/` (`docs/explanations/template-dev.md`,
"Accumulate ethics/regional/operational rules as sections first") follow
the same BDFL split as everything else, stated explicitly because the
research is meant to be collaborative:

- **The maintainer owns the default rules.** What a generated project's
  baseline says (the `baseline/*` sections' substance, every section's
  promotion to `active`/`kind`, its enforcement level, and its
  distribution gate) is the maintainer's decision. This is the same
  authority as the roadmap bullet above, applied to the registry.
- **Contributors own the legwork.** Researching a rule with primary
  sources, drafting a new section (copy
  [_shared/ethics/_template.md.jinja](_shared/ethics/_template.md.jinja),
  register it, stay `draft` — the runbook is
  [docs/how-to/ethics-section.md](docs/how-to/ethics-section.md)),
  proposing a text change or an enforcement lift (L0 → L1/L2), and
  re-checking a section whose `review_by` has come due are all welcome
  without prior agreement. A draft ships nowhere and moves nothing: no
  questionnaire, no leaf, no render changes.
- **Promotion is the maintainer's merge.** The bundle condition (three
  sections sharing one distribution condition, or one section needing a
  distinct code/test gate) and the wiring a promotion must carry are the
  checklist in the runbook above.
- **Sections age on purpose.** Every row names a `review_by`; a passed
  date fails `tests/test_ethics_registry.py` (so CI reddens) until the
  sources are re-checked and the row is bumped or superseded. Sections
  are one-line summaries plus links, never pasted statutes, and keep the
  not-legal-advice disclaimer: the template states rules of thumb, it
  does not give legal advice.

## Relationship to upstream

This repository started as a fork of
[DiamondLightSource/python-copier-template](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python-copier-template)
and is being prepared for an independent v1.0 release (see TODO item 11).
Upstream remains credited as the origin; governance here is independent of
upstream governance.

## Changes to this document

Amendments follow the same path as any other change: an issue, then a PR
reviewed by the maintainer. Once a second maintainer exists, amendments to
this file will require both.
